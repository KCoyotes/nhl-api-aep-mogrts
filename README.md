This is an experimental project that aims to integrate the NHL's Stats API to populate motion graphics in After Effects and Premiere Pro. "Stats" does not exclusively mean point values about a player's performance, but can include full team rosters (with player names, jersey numbers, positions etc.) as well as Team, Division, and even Venue information.

The goal of this project is to reduce the amount of time Motion Graphics creators have to spend making dozens of verisons of the same graphic to account for each player on a team, matchups during a season, and more. An example of this would be automating the process of rendering dozens of unique player headshots, social matchup graphics, or unique event graphics (like goals, hat tricks, saves etc.), while only needing to design each graphic once.
